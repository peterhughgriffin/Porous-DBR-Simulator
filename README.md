# Porous DBR Simulator

This code has been written to simulate the reflectivity of porous GaN DBRs. It can be easily adapted to other porous DBRs by changing the refractive index of the solid medium and even of the pores (i.e. for pores filled with liquid).

## Prerequisites

The code is written for python 3 and requires aspects of numpy and scipy, and the example uses matplotlib.
Most crucially, the tmm package is required, which can be installed from here: https://pypi.org/project/tmm/

Once this has been installed the file TMM_Example should run as is, which demonstrates the main functionality of TMM_Class
